Hi, we are CROCSNT team, welcome to our Project. 

## About the project


we have developed an app using flutter. The app is based on an alert system for users in the Northern in relation to crocodiles. The app is designed to give the user an interface where he/she can track if there is any crocodiles in the area & predict the possibility of one being there. It sends a notification to the user, additionally the app also has an emergency contact page, a survival skills page and a page where the user can record/take picture and send it to wild life services of a crocodile seen or potential of one there.
